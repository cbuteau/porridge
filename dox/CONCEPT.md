
# Concept

## The Name

Serialization....serial rhymes with cereal...cereal is porridge...porridge

## The Goal

Build a straight C++ serialization library that supports multiple provides but provides JSON by default.


## Building on the name

Once Porridge was decided I also decioded all the terminology should be related to porridge.

For instance cook is the contructor that provides the data to retreive from deserialization.
